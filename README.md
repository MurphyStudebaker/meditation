# Inhale Meditation Timer

Hello friend, this is the code repository for [Inhale](inhale.netlify.app), a simple timer for unguided meditations. Our goal is to create a delightful tool you'll happily use at work, on the go, or in your home to add minfulness to every part of your day. We welcome feature requests, grammar corrections, and contributions of any kind. 

Built with NextJS + TailwindCSS + p5.js, and deployed on Netlify.
